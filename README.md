# AutomaticBabyCradle_using_PIDcontroller
 Designing an automatic baby craddle by using PID controller to supervise the input output interacting.
 
 The automatic baby craddle is modelled after a simple mass-damper-spring system as per the picture below:

 The closed-loop transfer function for the whole system is derived as below:

 Next, the stability of the system is checked using Bode diagram. With and without controller.
